## Preview

Since the project was too large, I couldnâ€™t upload it directly to GitHub. Instead, you can find it on [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1maV3yC9_M3q0WOxBOvnWGwhzxHk9HTs0?dmr=1&ec=wgc-drive-globalnav-goto).

On the Google Drive folder, you'll find the following:
  - Android application: This is the project itself
  - Video: A recording showing how the app works
  - Target image: Required for scanning when you run the app

## My Contributions

This app builds upon models and designs I created previously. You can find my models here on github: 
  - [tower](https://github.com/HMByteSensei/BlenderTowerModel)
  - [flag](https://github.com/HMByteSensei/FlagModelForMyApp)

The **ship** and **cannon** models used in this project were downloaded from online 3D model platforms. Unfortunately, I was unable to locate the exact links to the original files. If you recognize your work in this project, please reach out so I can properly credit you.
